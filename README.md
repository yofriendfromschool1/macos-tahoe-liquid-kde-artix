# macOS Tahoe Liquid Theme for Plasma 6.6/6.7+

[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde?label=release&color=blue)](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/releases) [![tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-1378_passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![plasma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plasma-6.6%2B-1d99f3?logo=kde)](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-blue)](LICENSE) [![report a bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/report-a%20bug-red?logo=github)](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/new)

Bring a little Tahoe to your Linux desktop.

A macOS Tahoe-inspired theme for KDE Plasma 6.6 and 6.7+, with liquid glass, a top menu bar, a Dock, matching app themes, sounds, and a boot screen. Pick the parts you like in the installer.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is experimental and under active development. Don't use it on a production system yet. KDE, KWin, or Kvantum updates may temporarily break parts of the theme; running `sudo ./install` again usually restores them. If something goes wrong, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/new).

### Acrylic Glass Tahoe Launcher

Find an app with a quick search, keep your favorites close, or browse with a choice of two views.

  <img src="src/screenshots/launcher_dark_v3.png" width="415">
</p>

<br>

### Acrylic Glass Tahoe Dock

Your apps sit on a glass Dock that refracts the wallpaper, with hover zoom and notification badges to show what needs your attention.

<p align="center">

</p>

<br>

### Acrylic Glass Tahoe Finder

Give Nautilus a familiar Finder feel, with a macOS-style sidebar and a simpler toolbar in both light and dark modes.

</p>

<br>

### Acrylic Glass Tahoe Menu

Keep the system menu, active app name, and window controls together in the top bar, with app menus available for applications that support the global menu.

<br>

### System Information

Check your computer's details in a glass window that fits the rest of the desktop.

<br>

### Plasma Theme

Even the desktop's right-click menu gets the glass treatment, with a translucent background and blur.

</p>

<br>

### Boot Splash

An Apple-style logo sits at the center of each monitor, scaling to fit displays from 1080p to 4K. A progress bar appears during startup; shutdown and reboot keep the same layout without it. If your disk uses LUKS2 encryption, Plymouth shows a masked passphrase field below the logo.

![Getting started](https://img.shields.io/badge/getting-started-3B7B5B?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)

Open the graphical installer and choose what you'd like to install or remove:

```bash
./installer
```

For the same choices in a terminal wizard:

```bash
sudo ./install
sudo ./uninstall
```

Both installers show live progress and support English, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese. Run `sudo ./install --help` for all options.

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

- KDE Plasma 6.6+
- Python 3.10+
- `sudo`
- Qt 6 development tools
- KDE and Qt 6 development packages for the compiled plasmoids and KWin effects
- `cmake`, `g++`, and `pkg-config` when compiled features are selected
- `dbus-send`
- `systemctl` or `crontab` for scheduled features

Theme assets are bundled. The optional KDE Rounded Corners effect needs an internet connection; the rest installs without it.

| Distro | Qt 6 tools | KDE Plasma 6 development packages |
|--------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Arch family | `pacman -S qt6-tools` | `pacman -S extra-cmake-modules plasma-workspace kdecoration libplasma libnotificationmanager libksysguard plasma-activities-stats` |
| Gentoo | `emerge dev-qt/qttools:6` | `emerge kde-frameworks/extra-cmake-modules kde-plasma/plasma-workspace kde-plasma/kdecoration kde-plasma/libplasma kde-plasma/libnotificationmanager kde-plasma/libksysguard kde-plasma/plasma-activities-stats` |

| openSUSE Tumbleweed | `zypper install qt6-tools-devel` | `zypper install extra-cmake-modules plasma6-workspace-devel kdecoration-devel libKF6Plasma-devel libnotificationmanager6-devel libksysguard6-devel libKF6PlasmaActivitiesStats6-devel` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Choose features and theme mode</b></summary>

Any flag skips the terminal wizard. Use `--no-<name>` to leave out a component, or `--only` to install or remove selected components:

```bash
sudo ./install --no-gtk --no-sddm
sudo ./install --only --fonts --icons
sudo ./uninstall --only --cursors
```

Available feature names:

`wallpapers`, `fonts`, `cursors`, `plasma-theme`, `window-decorations`, `kvantum`, `color-schemes`, `icons`, `plasmoids`, `globalmenu`, `acrylic-glass`, `rounded-corners`, `global-theme`, `layout`, `sounds`, `gtk`, `firefox`, `sddm`, `apps`, `nautilus`, `nautilus-bookmarks`, `portals`, `oled-care`, `plymouth`.

Choose the initial theme mode:

```bash
sudo ./install          # automatic light/dark schedule
sudo ./install --light
sudo ./install --dark
```

Switch later with:

```bash
mac-tahoe-theme-switch light
mac-tahoe-theme-switch dark
mac-tahoe-theme-switch auto
```

Save or reset installer choices:

```bash
sudo ./install --no-gtk --dark --save
sudo ./install --reset
```

Useful maintenance options:

- `--preflight` checks the system without installing.
- `--no-apply-theme` stages files without switching the desktop.
- `--no-grub-modify` leaves `/etc/default/grub` unchanged.
- Theme changes keep any wallpaper you've chosen for each monitor.
- `--reset-wallpapers` returns all monitors to the bundled light/dark wallpapers.
- `./legacy-install` and `./legacy-uninstall` use the classic prompt instead of the terminal wizard.

<summary><b>Glass and rounded-corner troubleshooting</b></summary>

VirtualBox VM surfaces are excluded from Acrylic Glass in v0.53.0 to prevent
glass from filling fullscreen or seamless windows. The VirtualBox manager
keeps its normal appearance ([#90](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/90)).

If small triangles appear at window corners with both effects enabled, open
**System Settings → Window Management → Desktop Effects → Acrylic Glass**
and adjust the window, dock, and popup corner radii. Setting them to `28`
resolved the reported case. Starting with v0.53.0, reinstall preserves these
adjustments. The effects retain independent defaults; this release does not
automatically change existing radii ([#89](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/89)).

The desktop-edit overlay reported with ShapeCorners remains under investigation.
Disabling **KDE Rounded Corners** in Desktop Effects was the reporter's
workaround ([#77](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/77)).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Firefox theme and profile safety</b></summary>

The Firefox theme works with native, Flatpak, and Snap profiles. Your browser data and existing customizations are preserved. Restart the browser to see the changes.

UI settings are backed up before changes, and uninstall removes the theme's additions. Backups remain in `~/.local/state/mac-tahoe-liquid-kde/firefox/snapshots/` for recovery.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OLED care</b></summary>

OLED care is off by default. Enable it in the graphical feature picker or from the command line:

```bash
sudo ./install --oled-care
sudo ./install --oled-care --save
sudo ./install --no-oled-care
sudo ./install --oled-care --oled-interval=3 --oled-max-shift=4
```

Manual controls:

```bash
mac-tahoe-oled-care shift
mac-tahoe-oled-care restore
mac-tahoe-oled-care status
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test in a virtual machine</b></summary>

Try the theme in a disposable Plasma VM:

```bash
./vm <os>
```

**Choose your OS:** `cachyos` · `arch` · `manjaro` · `endeavouros` · `garuda` · `fedora` · `nobara` · `opensuse` · `neon` · `gentoo` · `gentoo-openrc`

Use `all` to launch every distro.

**Init systems**

| OpenRC | Supported | In progress |

Artix uses the Arch package mappings even when its `os-release` omits
`ID_LIKE=arch`. Dependency installation, all three C++ builds, the full test
suite, and crontab operations have been checked in an Artix OpenRC container.
Live installation testing is still needed; Artix is not yet included in the
automated container matrix. Scheduled theme changes and OLED care use
the existing per-user cron support and require a running cron daemon.

**Plasma versions**

| Plasma | Support | Since |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 6.5 and older | Not supported | Not applicable |
| 6.6 | Supported | v0.1.0 |
| 6.7+ | Supported | v0.19.0 |

<summary><b>Chromium-based app crashes with Global Menu</b></summary>

A GTK3 module lifetime defect causes the startup crash reproduced from
[issue #81](https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde/issues/81).
The affected Chromium startup code clears `gtk-modules` after GTK initializes.
Older `appmenu-gtk-module` builds then unload while their D-Bus callbacks and GTK
menu hooks remain registered. The next callback crashes the app. Upstream
addresses this by [making the module resident](https://gitlab.com/vala-panel-project/vala-panel-appmenu/-/commit/a783b01c8b653349843fac9bbd075dac52cdc9de).

The Global Menu installer now adds a Plasma login hook that includes the
installed module in `GTK3_MODULES`. GTK retains this startup reference for the
application's lifetime, including across light/dark switches. Existing module
choices are preserved, and the protection keeps GTK global menus available.

Run `sudo ./install` with Global Menu selected, then **log out and back in**.
The hook lives at
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/plasma-workspace/env/mac-tahoe-gtk-appmenu.sh`;
uninstall removes the project's hook. A fresh login is also required after
removal, because existing processes retain their startup environment.

To test one app before logging out, replace `your-application` below with its
executable:

```bash
env GTK3_MODULES="${GTK3_MODULES:+$GTK3_MODULES:}appmenu-gtk-module" your-application
```

Both reported ChatGPT builds, **26.831.21537 and 26.901.51231**, were tested
with fresh isolated profiles: each crashes without the hook and opens a visible
window with it. GDB traces match both application offsets in the report. See the
[validation record and repeatable probes](tests/native/gtk_appmenu_validation.md)
for the tested environment and scope. Avoid removing the module from live GTK
settings: that can itself trigger the unload defect in running apps.
